These are 5 lab assignments that was done throughout the Fall 2019 semester. 

Lab 1 and Lab 2:
* Establish the connection between server and client. 
* Client will request the server an URL. 
* Server will respond to client with the html of the URL request.

Lab 3 and Lab 4:
* Establish the connection between server and client.
* Client and Server will simulate 3 ways handshake of TCP protocol.
* The handshake will establish opening connection and closing connection.

Lab 5:
* Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from source to destination.

Overall:
- Lab 2 is the derivative of lab 1 but more advanced.
- Lab 4 is the derivative of lab 3 but more advanced.
- Lab 5 is on its own.
